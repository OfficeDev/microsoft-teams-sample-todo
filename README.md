# Microsoft Teams - Todo MVC Sample

This sample demonstrates on how to quickly integrate your existing Web Application with **Microsoft Teams**.

The following sample has been modified from **TodoMVC for React** that can be found [here](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/typescript-react).

## Running

The sample requires `node.js` and uses the following stack:

1. `React` as the UI Framework.
2. `TypeScript` as the transpiler.
3. `Director` for basic UI Routing.
4. `TodoMVC` base for TodoMVC like functionality.
5. `Webpack` as the build tool.

To get started:

1. Clone the project.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start` to start the `webpack-dev-server`.
4. Alternatively, run `npm run build` to generate a deployable build.
